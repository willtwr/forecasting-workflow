# Forecasting Workflow

Project for forecasting / prediction tasks.

## Purpose of this project

- To get familiar with other types of data (the author has been focusing on computer vision problems only).
- To understand better how to implement the following libraries:
    - Pandas
    - SQL (sqlalchemy, mysql-connector-python)
    - Traditional ML (scikit-learn, xgboost)
    - Training transformers using PyTorch
- Practice implementing tests better.
- Explore UV as the new package (and project/repo) manager.
- Try tools like mypy, ruff, etc. for better development experience.

## Takeaways

- UV is a lot better than PIP. Will migrate to UV in the future.
- Will start to employ more tools for cleaner codes, better coding experience, and more efficient debugging process.

## Others

- mkdocs implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/willtwr/info-search-summarize-workflow/tree/main).
